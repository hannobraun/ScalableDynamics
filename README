Scalable Dynamics (short: SD) is a 2D physics library targetted at games. It is written in Scala (http://scala-lang.org/).
SD is in early stages of development and still misses many basic features. The following functionality is currently implemented:
* Rigid bodies
* Linear movement
* Applying forces and impulses to bodies
* Supported body shapes: circles and line segment
* Continious collision detection between all supported shapes (except between line segments)
